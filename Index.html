    <h1>Expectations</h1>
    <p>Tell me how you feel about this class, what are you looking forward to, what are you afraid of?</p>

    <br>

    <p>Lauren: I'm quite stressed and nervous about this class, but I hope it will be okay!</p>
    <p>Marianne: I already took this course last year, but that doesn't mean I'm not looking forward to this one! :-) Last year was interesting and a review will be good.</p>
    <p>Siebe: I'm a little scary about this course because I'm mostly a designer.</p>
